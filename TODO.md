1. ## I18N
    * Structure of how I18N is done. Support FI, SV and default language (EN)
    * Navigation elements needs to be localised when those are rendered - **NOT DONE**
2. ## Automated testing
    * **NOT DONE** 
3. ## Linter / Flow
    * Basics done ... should be ok for now. Flow needs more emphasis. 
4. ## Offline support
    * **NOT DONE**, idea was to use [realm for javascript](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/). Needs more analysis. Idea is to render the views with Realm data and fetch new data from server and render if data has been changed.
5. ## Layout examples
    * Examples of navigation and some basic structure of the components. Needs __controlled component__ and more complex examples.
6. ## Serverless examples (Firebase)
    * **NOT DONE**
7. ## Analytics
    * **NOT DONE**
8. ## General architecture
    * [ES7](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/) syntax and [async await](https://egghead.io/courses/asynchronous-javascript-with-async-await) examples.
